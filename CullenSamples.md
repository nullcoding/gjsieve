# Introduction #

If you input 1 as lower bound and 63 as upper bound, these are the results you should see. Anything larger than 63 will, at present, return 0.

This should also explain why Cullen primes are significantly more rare than Generalized Fermat Primes, Proth Primes, and even Woodall Primes.
