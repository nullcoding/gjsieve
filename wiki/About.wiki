= Introduction =

gjsieve is a small experiment in Proth number testing. It is _not_ meant to be used for serious primality evaluation of large numbers. It probably never will be. 

= Details =

gjsieve is a C++ application to demonstrate Proth number functionality with the formula originally set down by French mathematician Francois Proth N = k(2^n)-1, where:

  * N is a Proth number
  * k is a positive, odd integer
  * n is a positive integer such that 2^n is greater than k
 
The application runs in a basic command prompt. The user enters a value of k, then a value of n. The application then performs a calculation of the Proth number N, and subsequently attempts to factor it. If the only factors found are 1 and N, the number is prime; if other factors exist, the number is composite.

The user is then given the option to either restart with new values or terminate the application.

gjsieve is currently a work in progress, in alpha stage, although it is stable. It can currently not be built or run on Mac OS X 64-bit and is untested on Mac OS X 32-bit.
