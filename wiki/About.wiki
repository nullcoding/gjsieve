gjsieve is a small experiment in Proth number testing

= Details =

gjsieve is a C++ application to demonstrate Proth number functionality with the formula originally set down by French mathematician Francois Proth N = k*(2^n)-1, where:

  * N is a Proth number
  * k is a positive, odd integer
  * n is a positive integer such that 2^n is greater than k
