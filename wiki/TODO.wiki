= Unfinished, high-priority =

  * Correct listing of negative numbers as factors that appears to happen at c > 2^30.
  * See if we can make it stop testing as soon as a factor is found != 1, != N and dismiss that N as composite.


  * *Eventually re-write for _either_ FFTW _or_ MPIR.*


= Unfinished, lower-priority = 

  * array input for k?
  * arraymaker.exe calls gjsieve_tester.exe

= Done = 

  * malloc allocates c+1 bytes of memory for c = 2^n each new line of arrays.txt
  * figure out why everything is "prime"
  * make it work properly within conditional statements
