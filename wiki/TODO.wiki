== Unfinished, high-priority ==

  * Fix file output, namely spacing and incomplete strings
  * Possibly allocate more memory to alleviate "Not Responding" even though it eventually works again...more an annoyance than an issue but there might be a fix out there somewhere

== Unfinished, lower-priority ==

  * custom application icon doesn't work - fix it
  * View menu does nothing but should probably do something
  * resizing the application window just makes it take up the whole screen and looks ugly (but does not affect functionality)

== Done == 

  * write the application
  * make it work
