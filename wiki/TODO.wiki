= Unfinished =

  * rewrite for unsigned long
  * allow user to pick an input value of k 1 through 50
  * make iterative algorithm testing from n=2 through n=50
  * automatically make lowest n value smallest value for which 2^n > k
  * print results of iterative algorithm to stdout
  * display list of all primes that exist (that is all N for ( i == N )

= Done = 

  * loop function (v2 JB)
  * prompt user for additional input or exit (v2 JB)
  * change from (if yes) to do-while (v3 GA)
