= Unfinished, high-priority =

  * rewrite for unsigned long
  *      ALSO ensure that larger numbers (k>50, n>29) do not cause maxErr

= Unfinished, lower-priority = 

  * automatically make lowest n value smallest value for which 2^n > k
  * display list of all primes that exist (that is all N for ( i == N )

= Done = 

  * loop function (v2 JB)
  * prompt user for additional input or exit (v2 JB)
  * change from (if yes) to do-while (v3 GA)
  * make iterative algorithm testing from lower to upper bound (v4 GA)
  * print results of iterative algorithm to stdout (results.txt) (v4 JB)
