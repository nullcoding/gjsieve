= Other Versions =

In our Source section, you will find a branches subsection of SVN. There are several programs there.
 
  * Fermat numbers (2^(2^n)-1)
  * Woodall numbers (2•(2^n)-1)
  * Cullen numbers (2•(2^n)+1)
  * Mersenne numbers ((2^n)-1)

These programs all work. However, some notes about each:

  * Fermat tester works only up to n = 5. Because it calls a power function, rather than multiplication, the resulting integers overflow quickly.
  * Woodall tester works only up to n = 28.
  * Cullen tester works only up to n = 63. *However* this is proof that our program(s) can handle output larger than 11 digits.

= IsItPrime = 

IsItPrime is a simple command-line test of a number's prime or composite properties. Although it asks for "y" or "n" input, please use 0 or 1...for now.
