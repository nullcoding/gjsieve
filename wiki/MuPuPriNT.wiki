MuPuPriNT v0.2
Testing Alpha

==About==

MuPuPriNT (MUlti PUrpose PRIme Number Tester) is a program containing five separate prime-testing programs:

  *GJSieve (Proth Numbers)
  *GJSieveC (Cullen Numbers)
  *GJSieveW (Woodall Numbers)
  *PythNT (Pythagorean Numbers)
  *IsItPrime? (Any number)

Each individual program is currently FULLY FUNCTIONAL. 

This means that the MATH side of things works fine! Each program will do exactly what it ought to. No more, no less.

----

==For Reference==

  *Proth number = k*2^n +1 where k is a positive odd integer and n is a positive integer such that 2^n > k
  *Cullen number = n*2^n +1 where n is a positive integer
  *Woodall number = n*2^n -1 where n is a positive integer
  *Pythagorean number = 4n +1 where n is a positive integer and the resulting number is the hypotenuse of a Pythagorean triangle

----

==Known Issues==

  *Results files in any program will STILL sometimes print text l i k e t h i s (sorry) and/or cut off at a certain point (usually around the "formula" section. I do not know why beyond that it has something to do with character encoding (which is, by default, Unicode).

  *Although IsItPrime? will now allow you to input very large numbers, it won't accept anything longer than 30,000 digits. This, I believe, is unchangable. But that doesn't mean I won't try to change it.

----

==Not Yet Implemented==

  *The View menu is entirely useless. Still. Sorry for not having the option to dye the window purple or anything...yet.

  *The buttons are much less boring. In fact, they are downright shiny! But they will not display the icons I am telling them to...

----

==Notes==

N.B: If the program says "Not Responding," WAIT! It IS working, but for some odd reason I cannot place, it will not output any kind of "Working..." text or progress indicator despite the progress bar I implemented.

If it stops responding for more than twenty minutes, kill it, or else stop entering values of n in the tens of millions...


As always, feedback is welcome via email.

Also, if you have an idea for a better name, let me know.

Enjoy...
