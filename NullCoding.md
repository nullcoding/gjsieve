# About #

The name "nullcoding" was originally a joke. Jaska began calling himself by this nickname online towards the end of 2008, a reference to his failed attempts to teach himself VB for use in Excel.

Jaska has a long history of teaching himself things, from musical instruments to languages. He began seriously learning C/C++ on his own time around the beginning of July 2012, and about a week later began teaching himself the Windows API as well.

Now, Jaska is a fairly proficient, but definitely still amateur programmer.

In his spare time, he enjoys sleeping.

Jaska does not have much spare time, since he works as a computer technician at Dickinson College, where he also studies Chinese and computer science - the latter is a recent addition.

He is bad at talking about himself - guess who wrote this. No, really, guess - but is completely serious when he thanks his friends for their support and encouragement, since even though they mostly know nothing about programming (or any of his hobbies), they are still impressed by what he has done.
