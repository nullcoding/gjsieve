## Overview ##

GJSieve for Mac is a side project of mine as I learn Objective-C and the Cocoa API.

Find the current version [here](http://code.google.com/p/gjsieve/downloads/detail?name=gjsmac_v02.zip).

## Issues ##

  * the program will crash if you put in massive numbers. Actually, I'm not sure if it's working or not. I imagine if you give it enough time, it will do its thing. But for now it beachballs.
  * some buttons (Save As PDF and Open Readme) do nothing.
  * there is no readme to open. sorry!
  * Instructions is simplistic and uninformative. working on it.
  * only with _small_ numbers: some of them are false-positive for primality, and the program may also report that 2-digit numbers in fact have 3. I am not sure why! It's right with big or huge numbers.
  * it's an early alpha that I wrote in about a day and a half

## To-Do ##

  * icon
  * picture in that blank spot in the main window
  * buttons that work
  * operate progress bar on a different thread if at all possible
  * ability to save results
  * basically give the app the same functionality as its Windows counterpart

## Note ##

You CAN save stuff here. Just go File > Print and save as PDF!

uh that's about it for now.
